### Pookalam Description

My Pookalam is an interactive digital floral carpet that brings the spirit of Onam to life. When users open the link, they are greeted by a hero section, inviting them to start creating. Users can upload an image, and the Pookalam automatically generates a flower pattern inspired by the picture, blending colors and shapes creatively. On the side, Mahabali appears, adding a festive touch and greeting users. This combination of user interaction, custom-generated designs, and traditional Onam elements makes the Pookalam unique and engaging.



### Technologies Used 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript ‚Äì for structure, styling, and interactive logic

Canvas API ‚Äì for drawing the Pookalam
